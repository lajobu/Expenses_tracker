## Main functionalities:

The Expenses tracker web app could give the user a web tool to login with one username and
password, in order to introduce the outcomes and incomes. Once the data is introduced, the
user would be able to analyse it, so as to check how the money was spent, the current balance,
but also plot the data in a graph.
