# SQL queries:

 ## For this application I created seven queries:

### [1. Create values](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/1.%20Create%20values.sql)
* It creates the main values for the tables: Vendor, Category, User and
Sender. Hence it populates the tables.

### [2. Current balance](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/2.%20Current%20Balance.sql)
* It shows the current balance of the user: jorge10, total incomes minus total outcomes, returns a single value.

### [3. Outcome vendor](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/3.%20Outcome%20vendor.sql)
* It shows the total amount spent by vendor (Biedronka), for the user:

### [4. Outcome category month year](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/4.%20Outcome%20category%20month%20year.sql)
* It shows the total amount spent by category (Parties), for the user: jorge10, during the month of December 2019, returns a single value.

### [5. Average spent category](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/5.%20Average%20spent%20category.sql)
* Average spent by category (Rent), for the user: jorge10, returns a single value rounded up to two decimals.

### [6. Outcome table](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/6.Outcome%20table.sql)
* Table with amount_outcome, category_name and vendor_name, during December 2019, for the user: jorge10.

### [7. Create values](https://github.com/lajobu/Expenses_tracker/blob/master/SQL/7.Sum%20outcomes%20table.sql)
